# Genetic Algorithm
Genetic Algorithms(GAs) are adaptive heuristic search algorithms that belong to the larger part of evolutionary algorithms. Genetic algorithms are based on the ideas of natural selection and genetics. These are intelligent exploitation of random search provided with historical data to direct the search into the region of better performance in solution space. They are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions for optimization problems and search problems.

# Algorithm

1. Randomly initialize populations p
2. Determine fitness of population
3. Until convergence repeat:
      a. Select parents from population
      b. Crossover and generate new population
      c. Perform mutation on new population
      d. Calculate fitness for new population

# Problem Statement

Given a target string, the goal is to produce target string starting from a random string of the same length. 
In the following implementation, following analogies are made â€“ 

* Characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and other special symbols are considered as genes
* A string generated by these characters is considered as chromosome/solution/Individual
